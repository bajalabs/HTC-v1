# File Download Location in Docker and Playwright MCP

When you download files using Docker and Playwright MCP, the files are saved in **temporary directories** within the Docker container. Here's what you need to know about where these files are stored:

## Default Download Locations

**Inside the Docker Container:**

- Downloaded files are stored in a temporary directory, typically `/tmp/playwright-artifacts-<random-id>/`[^1][^2]
- Each download gets a unique temporary path like `/tmp/playwright-artifacts-zUHKYv/ab49a46d-cdcb-46fb-bd5a-8695661713e3`[^1]
- These temporary files are automatically deleted when the browser context that created them is closed[^3]

**Container Temporary Directory:**

- Docker containers use `/tmp` as the default temporary directory for file operations[^4]
- The specific Playwright temporary artifacts folder is created within this `/tmp` directory[^1]


## Accessing Downloaded Files

There are several ways to access your downloaded files:

### 1. Using Playwright's Download API

When handling downloads in Playwright MCP, you can:

- Use `download.path()` to get the temporary file path[^3]
- Use `download.saveAs(targetPath)` to save the file to a specific location[^3]
- Access `download.suggestedFilename()` to get the original filename[^1]


### 2. Volume Mounting

To persist downloaded files outside the container, you need to mount a volume:

```bash
docker run -v /host/download/path:/container/download/path your-playwright-image
```


### 3. Configuring Download Directory

You can specify a custom downloads directory when launching the browser:

```javascript
const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch({
    downloadsPath: '/app/downloads'  // Custom download directory
});
```


## Important Considerations

**Temporary Nature:**

- Files in `/tmp/playwright-artifacts-*` directories are temporary and will be deleted when the browser context closes[^3]
- If you need to preserve downloads, you must either save them to a mounted volume or copy them before the context closes

**Docker Container Isolation:**

- Files downloaded inside a Docker container are isolated from the host system unless you explicitly mount volumes[^5]
- Without volume mounting, downloads exist only within the container's filesystem

**MCP Server Limitations:**

- Currently, some Playwright MCP implementations don't provide direct access to download file contents[^6]
- There are ongoing efforts to add tools like `browser_downloads_list` and `browser_file_download` to access downloaded files through MCP[^6]


## Best Practices

1. **Mount a Volume:** If you need to access downloaded files from the host system, mount a volume to the container's download directory
2. **Save Files Explicitly:** Use `download.saveAs()` to save files to a persistent location before the browser context closes
3. **Monitor Disk Space:** Temporary files can accumulate, so ensure adequate disk space in `/tmp`[^4]

The exact location depends on your specific Docker setup and how you've configured the Playwright MCP server, but the temporary directory pattern (`/tmp/playwright-artifacts-*`) is consistent across implementations.
